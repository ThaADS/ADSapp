## Recording Best Practices

### Voice Performance
**Do**:
- Smile while speaking (heard in voice)
- Vary pitch and tone naturally
- Emphasize key points
- Pause between sentences
- Stay hydrated
- Stand if it helps energy

**Don't**:
- Rush through script
- Speak in monotone
- Clear throat into microphone
- Eat/drink during recording (water between takes only)
- Record when tired or sick
- Push through if voice is strained

### Screen Recording
**Do**:
- Move mouse slowly and purposefully
- Hold clicks slightly longer than normal
- Pause on important UI elements
- Use zoom/highlight features for small elements
- Record extra B-roll footage
- Capture multiple angles of same action

**Don't**:
- Move mouse erratically
- Click too quickly
- Cover important content with cursor
- Navigate too fast for viewers to follow
- Forget to show results of actions
- Skip confirmation dialogs

### Handling Mistakes
**Minor Mistake** (word stumble):
- Pause 2 seconds
- Repeat from last sentence
- Continue smoothly

**Major Mistake** (wrong action, missing step):
- Stop recording
- Fix the issue
- Start fresh take or do pickup shot

**Technical Issue** (notification, system alert):
- Stop recording immediately
- Fix technical issue
- Start take over from beginning of that section

## Common Recording Problems & Solutions

### Problem: External Noise During Recording

**Prevention**:
- Record early morning or late evening
- Use white noise machine outside door
- Notify household of schedule
- Choose quietest room in building

**Solution During Recording**:
- Pause recording immediately
- Wait for noise to pass
- Resume with pickup line

**Post-Recording Fix**:
- Use noise reduction in editing
- Record room tone for noise profiling
- Re-record section if noise severe

---

### Problem: Computer Performance Issues

**Prevention**:
- Close all unnecessary applications
- Reboot before recording session
- Clear temp files
- Record to fast SSD, not network drive

**Solution During Recording**:
- Lower recording quality temporarily
- Restart computer
- Close browser tabs incrementally
- Free up RAM

**Post-Recording Fix**:
- Use proxy files in editing
- Upgrade computer specs if recurring

---

### Problem: Forgot to Record Important Element

**Prevention**:
- Follow storyboard strictly
- Check off shots as completed
- Review script one more time before finishing

**Solution**:
- Record pickup shot immediately
- Match lighting and audio to original
- Note exact timestamp where it fits

**Post-Recording Fix**:
- Schedule additional recording session
- Shoot multiple angles for editing flexibility

---

### Problem: Energy/Voice Fatigue

**Prevention**:
- Schedule recording for your peak energy time
- Well-rested before session
- Limit consecutive recording to 2-3 hours
- Take breaks every 45 minutes

**Solution During Recording**:
- Stop and take extended break (15-30 min)
- Reschedule remainder for another day
- Don't push through - bad takes waste time

**Post-Recording Fix**:
- Record affected sections another day
- Match energy level to existing recordings
- Use audio editing to balance

## Recording Efficiency Tips

1. **Batch Similar Videos**: Record all "setup" videos in one session while environment is configured

2. **Record Multiple Takes**: 2-3 takes of each section provides editing options

3. **Overshoot B-Roll**: Extra footage of UI, animations, workflows useful in editing

4. **Use Teleprompter App**: Display script near camera for more natural delivery

5. **Record Room Tone**: 60 seconds of silence in recording space for noise reduction

6. **Test First, Record Second**: Always do test recording before "real" takes

7. **Stand When Recording Voiceover**: Better breath support and energy

8. **Time of Day Matters**: Your voice sounds different - stay consistent

9. **Hydrate Properly**: Room-temperature water, avoid ice (constricts vocal cords)

10. **Save Often**: Auto-save in software, manual save after each take
