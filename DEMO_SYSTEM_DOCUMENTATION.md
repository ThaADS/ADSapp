## Usage Examples

### Creating a Demo Session
```sql
-- Create an e-commerce demo session
SELECT * FROM create_demo_session(
    'ecommerce',
    'prospect@example.com',
    'John Doe',
    24,
    '{"utm_source": "google", "utm_campaign": "demo"}'::jsonb
);
```

### Validating Session Access
```sql
-- Validate demo session token
SELECT * FROM validate_demo_session('demo_token_12345');
```

### Tracking User Activity
```sql
-- Track page view
SELECT track_demo_activity(
    'demo_token_12345',
    'page_view',
    '{"page_title": "Dashboard"}'::jsonb,
    '/dashboard',
    45
);
```

### Converting to Real Account
```sql
-- Convert demo to real account
SELECT * FROM convert_demo_session(
    'demo_token_12345',
    'user_uuid_here',
    'My New Company',
    'my-new-company',
    'professional'
);
```

### Getting Analytics
```sql
-- Get session statistics
SELECT * FROM get_demo_session_stats();

-- Get conversion funnel
SELECT * FROM get_demo_conversion_funnel();
```

- Automatic data cleanup after expiration
- Audit logging for compliance

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Daily**: Monitor active session count and conversion rates
2. **Weekly**: Review conversion funnel performance
3. **Monthly**: Analyze template performance and optimize content
4. **Quarterly**: Review security policies and access patterns

### Automated Cleanup
- Expired sessions automatically removed
- Data cleanup runs on schedule
- Reset logs maintained for audit
- Performance monitoring built-in

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling through read replicas
- Efficient indexing for performance
- Optimized queries for analytics
- Connection pooling for high concurrency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Session Not Accessible**
   - Check session expiration time
   - Validate token format
