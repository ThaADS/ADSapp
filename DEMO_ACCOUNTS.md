## Database Information

**Table:** `organizations`
- ID: `d6c6e3de-cab8-42d0-b478-69818f9773e9`
- All users share the same `organization_id` in their profiles

**Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Each user can only access data from their own organization
- Permissions are enforced at the database level
- All queries automatically filter by `organization_id`

---

### Authentication

POST /api/auth/signin
{
  "email": "owner@demo-company.com",
  "password": "Demo2024!Owner"
}
```

### Get Conversations (authenticated)

Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Information:**

1. **Demo Data Only:** These accounts contain dummy data for testing purposes only
2. **Non-Production:** Do not use these credentials in production environments
3. **WhatsApp API:** The WhatsApp credentials are placeholders and need to be configured with real API keys for actual messaging
4. **Password Policy:** Passwords follow the format `Demo2024!{Role}` for easy testing
5. **Email Confirmed:** All accounts have `email_confirm` set to `true` to bypass verification

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Log In
- Verify the email and password are correct (case-sensitive)
- Check that the account is active in the database
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser or incognito mode

### Missing Organization Data
- Verify `organization_id` is set in the user's profile
- Check that the organization exists in the database
- Review RLS policies in Supabase

### Permission Errors
- Confirm the user's role matches expected permissions
- Check RLS policies in the Supabase dashboard
- Verify the user is accessing routes appropriate for their role
